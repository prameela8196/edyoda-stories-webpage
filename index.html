                            Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to
                            give
                            computer systems the ability to “learn” (e.g., progressively improve performance on a
                            specific
                            task)
                            from data, without being explicitly programmed. Think of how efficiently (or not) Gmail
                            detects
                            spam
                            emails, or how good text-to-speech has become with the rise of Siri, Alexa, and Google Home.
