                            If you are a fresh graduate - or new to IT - looking for the next job, you need to read
                            this.

                            The last couple of years zekeLabs gave me a unique opportunity to assess technology demand
                            in
                            the industry and also to evaluate available talent pool for the demand.

                            Our consulting and technology training assignments for our corporate partners enlightened us
                            on
                            the technology skill in demand. We discovered - What, Where and which technologies are
                            increasingly being adopted by the Industry.

                    <h2>Big Data: Importance of Big Data Management and its Challenges</h2>
                    <p><span>EdYoda</span>&nbsp;| 23 Jul 2019</p>
                    <p> Big data is the phrase that is used to define large structured and unstructured volumes of data
                        that
                        has the potential to be mined for information and used in machine learning projects and other
                        advanced analytics applications. According to the big data management, the quality of the data
                        should be high and there should be accessibility for business intelligence. This information
                        benefits corporations, government agencies, and other agencies to develop strategies to help
                        them
                        cope up with the fast-growing amount of data, typically involving the large size of data saved
                        in
                        many file formats

                    <p><span>EdYoda</span>&nbsp;| 26 Aug 2019</p>
                    <p> As the dependency on online platforms is increasing daily, cybersecurity is becoming an
                        important
                        concern for all companies today. The number of cyberattacks is ever-rising even after
                        adopting
                        every
                        security measure possible by businesses. Cyber attackers are developing advancing
                        technologies
                        that
                        are continuing to cause more damage. There are many methods through which a cyber attack is
                        committed like software vulnerabilities, user interaction (using malicious links, email
                        attachments)
                        and use of stolen credentials logins, encryption keys.

                    <p> A business must always introspect the areas where they lack in order to bring about a
                        positive
                        change in the work environment. One of the main precautions or a contingency plan that is
                        necessary
                        for every business and especially industries working with clouds, networks and computers
                        should
                        conduct a backup of its files which will serve as a boon in any point of time.

                        Before moving forward, let us understand the concept of Data Backup and Recovery.

                    <p> What is machine learning, and why do we care?

                        Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to
                        give
                        computer systems the ability to “learn” (e.g., progressively improve performance on a
                        specific
                        task)
                        from data, without being explicitly programmed. Think of how efficiently (or not) Gmail
                        detects
                        spam
                        emails, or how good text-to-speech has become with the rise of Siri, Alexa, and Google Home.

                    <h2>Introduction To A Machine Learning Online Course</h2>
                    <p><span>EdYoda</span>&nbsp;| 23 Jul 2019</p>
                    <p> We have had an insight into Artificial Intelligence. Well, one of its subfields is machine
                        learning
                        and this introduction will help you get a fair idea of what a machine learning online course
                        holds.
                        To begin with, one must understand what machine learning is. Basically, it is a concept
                        wherein
                        a
                        machine attempts to understand the structure of a data and fits that into models that people
                        can
                        understand and utilize. While traditional forms of computing were all about solving problems
                        using
                        set instructions and data, machine learning is all about computers utilizing data, training
                        on
                        it
                        and using statistical data to output values. Thus, in this way, the process of
                        decision-making
                        is
                        automated for computers based on sample input data. Now that we know what Machine Learning
                        is
                        all
                        about, it’s time to delve in a little deeper.
